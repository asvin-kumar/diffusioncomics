## Log into TACC
`ssh asvin@ls6.tacc.utexas.edu`  
LuckyMonkey!!  
\< Get TACC Code from Asvin \>

TACC has three main directories, 
1. /home/
2. /work/
3. /scratch/

Use /home just as a login landing page. Don't save much here. 

Use /work to put all code. Create a folder for our project here.

Use /scratch for saving datasets. If data saved here is not modified/accessed once in every 2 weeks it'll get deleted.

Use command `cdw` to go to the /work directory.
Use command `cds` to go the /scratch directory.
You can also do `cdw folder-name` to directly navigate to that folder in /work. This format works for /scratch too.
